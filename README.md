# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

This repository contains the R script and tidy dataset for the final project of the *Getting and Cleaning Data* course in the Data Science specialization.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a tidy dataset from the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset. The original data contains sensor signals collected from smartphones worn by participants performing various activities.

## Files Included

- `run_analysis.R`: R script that downloads, processes, and tidies the dataset.
- `tidy_data.txt`: Final tidy dataset containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- `CodeBook.md` or `CodeBook.html`: Describes the variables, data structure, and transformations applied.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository:
